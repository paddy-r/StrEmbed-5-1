2019-08-07  TH: Created lib folder, and examples folder. Lib is for python modules. Created step_parse.py module so it can be used else where.  Might be worth adding things you create to that file once you've tested them, so differemnt functions can be accessed easily. Added tree drawing function, produces tree in json format which is what I've been doing so far, but I find it a bit clunky, feel free to use a different format for tree structures if you find a better way and I will convert to that.
