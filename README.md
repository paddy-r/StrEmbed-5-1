<i>Instructions for use of StrEmbed-5-1  
StrEmbed-5 is written in Python and uses the modules listed in the "Requirements" document  
A graphical user interface for visualisation and manipulation of part-whole relationships in assemblies of parts</i>  

Two scripts are required:
1. StrEmbed_5_1
2. step_parse_5_1

StrEmbed-5 was developed in Spyder, an IDE for packaged with the Anaconda distribution, which can be downloaded [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

STEP files are used for data transfer and several examples are provided in the 'Examples / Models' folder

In addition, for the torch example, part images are given in the 'Images' folder, where image names correspond to their product definitions in the STEP file; they are currently pre-rendered but will be generated automatically in the next version
